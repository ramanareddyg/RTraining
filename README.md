# RTraining
Some materials I used to Train basics of R

This year I had a chance to train people to start using R for thier day to day data wrangling. The audience consisted of people who were data 
savvy but were mainly using Excel to do all the data work. 

The objective was to get them started on data.table package which in my opinion is one of the best data wrangling packages out there.

It gets the job done. The code focuses mostly on things that they need on a daily basis like

- Aggregation/ summary generation
- Sorting
- Subsetting
- Merging
